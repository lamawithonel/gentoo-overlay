As of November 7, 2018 and >=net-misc/dropbox-61, Dropbox officialy ended
support for non-ext4 filesystems in their Linux client.  As a result, users
who store their Dropbox directory on non-ext4 filesystems must migrate them to
an ext4 filesystem, or find an alternative workaround.  See the reference
links for more information.
